# Gaze

Developed as part of TK, this series of scripts processes a combination of raw data from an EyeMotions tracker and defined experimental parameters to output data for later statistical analysis. In particular, these scripts track pupil movement throughout a series of tasks and output data such as Markov chains and proportion spent looking at certain AOIs. While these scripts were designed for a specific task, the modules and methods may be more broadly applicable.
